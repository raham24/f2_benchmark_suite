System Requirements:
- AWS EC2 F2 instance (recommended f2.48xlarge)
- Python 3.6+
- Sufficient memory for test data arrays

VALIDATION APPROACH
===================

The benchmarks are designed to:
1. Stress test memory subsystems (simulating FPGA memory access)
2. Measure realistic operation throughput (matching FPGA workload patterns)
3. Test parallel scaling (utilizing multiple FPGAs)
4. Monitor system efficiency (CPU/memory utilization vs. throughput)

Results should be compared against:
- AWS published F2 performance specifications
- cl_mem_perf results from AWS FPGA Development Kit
- Industry FPGA benchmark standards

NOTES AND LIMITATIONS
====================

1. These are CPU-based simulations of FPGA operations
2. Actual FPGA performance will depend on custom logic implementation
3. Real FPGA benchmarks require AWS FPGA Development Kit and AFI creation
4. Network I/O testing not included (would require specific setup)
5. Results are indicative and should be validated with actual FPGA implementations

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
===================

1. Integration with actual AWS FPGA Development Kit
2. Network throughput testing (DPDK integration)
3. Power consumption monitoring
4. Comparison with F1 instance performance
5. Custom AFI benchmark creation
6. Multi-instance distributed testing
